        <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Shahriyar Shawon but you can call me Shay. I'm a computer science student so I have
            some interest in programming and I have some knowledge in gnu/linux systems. I also like linguistics but am
            not
            too knowledgeable in the field.
            This site was made for me to have my own little corner of the internet away from the larger
            social media platforms. A sort of independence to some extent.
        </p>

        <h2>Ok, so?</h2>
        <p> I'll probably end up having links to my socials and some videos I've uploaded to YouTube and I might
            post some tutorials on here or something. I don't really know yet. I'm making this website in order to learn
            some HTML and CSS
            and then I'll probably deploy it somewhere.
        </p>
